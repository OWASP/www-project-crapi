pitch: crAPI will help you to understand the ten most critical API security risks. crAPI is vulnerable by design, but you'll be able to safely run it to educate/train yourself.

crAPI stands for “Completely Ridiculous API”.  It simulates an API-driven, microservice-based web application that is a platform for vehicle owners.


Following in the footsteps of Webgoat and JuiceShop, crAPI is an intentionally vulnerable application. However, crAPI is primarily filled with API vulnerabilities for the purpose of teaching, learning, and practicing API security.

You will not find the mundane XSS and SQLi challenges in crAPI. crAPI specializes in the common vulnerabilities that happen in modern API-based applications, including all those in the OWASP Top 10 for APIs. All the challenges in crAPI are based on real-life vulnerabilities that were found in APIs of big companies like Facebook, Uber, and Shopify. 

crAPI exposes many different vulnerabilities, some of them are easy to find, and others require multiple steps and some creativity to exploit.

Enjoy exploring and learning with crAPI!
